    </p>
    <p><span>The Licensee may also reproduce the Licensed Software in as many copies as the Licensee deems necessary to protect it against loss and/or deterioration or to provide means of proof on condition that the Licensee reproduces and includes all proprietary and/or intellectual property notices on all copies of the Licensed Software.

    </p>
    <p><span>The use of the software on further servers is not allowed unless Logicasoft expressly grants its consent. Logicasoft may make its consent dependent upon the payment of an additional reasonable remuneration.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>Should the Licensee temporarily be unable to use the software on any of its servers or only with restrictions, in particular due to malfunctions or repair or maintenance work, it shall be entitled to use the software on a substitute computer for a transitional period. In the event of a permanent change of computer, the use of the software on the newly deployed computer is admissible; the software is then to be completely deleted from the computer previously deployed.</span>

    <p><span>The right of use granted by this EULA may only be exercised simultaneously by the </span><span>maximum number of users (as defined in the relevant documentation)</span><span>&nbsp;for whom the Licensee has paid the agreed remuneration. </span>
    </p>
    <p><span>This use is controlled by technical measures, which will limit the use to what is specifically authorized in this license. The Licensee explicitly acknowledges this fact.</span>

    <ul>
        <li><span>Licensee&rsquo;s internal business: </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>The Licensee may only use the Licensed Software for the purpose of processing its own internal business matters.

Data and information may only be made accessible to such persons who have a need to access the same for the use of the software on behalf of the Licensee.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Licensee is not permitted to re-translate the program code provided into other code forms (decompilation) or to carry out any other types of reverse engineering of the various production stages of the software. Any such intervention is only admissible within the limits laid down in Art. XI.300 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (implementing article 6 of EU Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of computer programs), in so far as it is indispensable in order to obtain the necessary information to create the inter-operability of the software with other software programs, and only in so far as this information is neither published nor otherwise freely accessible and the Licensee has not obtained it from Logicasoft in response to a corresponding inquiry. In the aforementioned case, the Licensee shall inform Logicasoft which parts of the software it is decompiling. Logicasoft may demand reasonable remuneration for the grant of access to the information and for the decompilation by the Licensee.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Licensee shall inform each employee of its business who has access to the Licensed Software or to copies of the same about the contents of these terms and conditions and shall ensure that the employees comply with the its provisions.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when applicable, for the purpose of locating and eliminating defects the Licensee has to grant Logicasoft access to the Licensed Software, at the option of Logicasoft either directly and/or by remote data transmission. Logicasoft shall be entitled to verify whether the Licensed Software is being used in compliance with this EULA. For this purpose, Logicasoft may demand information from the Licensee, in particular concerning the period and scope of the use of the Licensed Software, and may also inspect the books and documents, as well as the hardware and software of the Licensee. For this audit purpose the Licensee has to grant Logicasoft access to its business premises during normal business hours. The Licensee will provide reasonable assistance and access to information in the course of such audit. &nbsp;Logicasoft reserves the right to report the audit results to other Right Holders.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when applicable, should Logicasoft in the course of rectification, maintenance or customization provide the Licensee with additions (e.g. patches, additions to the user documentation) or a new release of the Licensed Software which replace any software previously supplied (&quot;Old Software&quot;), such addition shall also be governed by the provisions of these terms and conditions</span><span>. Where Logicasoft provides a new release of Licensed Software, the rights of the Licensee in accordance with these terms and conditions shall lapse in regard to the Old Software, even without any express demand for return by Logicasoft, as soon as the Licensee uses the new software productively.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each end of the authorization for use (e.g. rescission, replacement delivery, notice of termination), the Licensee undertakes to return the original Licensed Software together with all existing copies, reproductions and modifications of any kind. Should a physical surrender of the software and of the reproductions not be possible for technical reasons, the Licensee shall delete the same and confirm to Logicasoft in writing that it has complied with the foregoing duties.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an exceeding use without consent (in particular in the case of any simultaneous use by a larger number of users than agreed, or in the case of a use outside the licensed scope), Logicasoft shall be entitled to invoice the amount payable for the additional use in accordance with the Logicasoft price list valid at this point in time (increased by the amount of indemnity for compensation resulting from the intellectual property infringement as applicable under the applicable law). For the duration of the default, Logicasoft may revoke the entitlement to use any such deliveries or performances in regard to which the Licensee is in default of payment.</span>

    <p><span>(4) &nbsp;Should the Licensee have notified Logicasoft in due time of the existence of a reproducible and adequately specified defect covered by an applicable warranty, Logicasoft shall have the right to rectify the defect and shall at its option, perform the rectification through elimination of the defect or delivery of a new software release free from defects and free of charge or until the delivery of the defect-free release, in the form of a temporary defect correction. The Licensee shall be obliged to accept a new software release provided the functional scope in accordance with the agreement is kept. Following consultation with Logicasoft, the Licensee shall provide the necessary time and opportunity for Logicasoft to undertake all rectification measures and replacement deliveries which the Logicasoft considers necessary. Should the attempt to rectify the defect definitively fail, the Licensee is entitled to rescind the contract. Rescission is precluded if the breach of duty by Logicasoft is only insignificant.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(5) &nbsp;In any case, no defect exists if a) the software is used in the operations of the Licensee in a functional connection with hardware and software components already present or acquired from a third party, where the defect is caused through components not supplied by Logicasoft or through their lack of compatibility. Where Logicasoft has explicitly given an express warranty as to compatibility with third party products, this only relates to the current product release at the time this warranty was given and not to any older or future product releases of this product or b) if and in so far as the defect results from the Licensee having failed to ensure compliance with technical framework conditions prescribed in the documentation and supplementary material.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it turn out that the Licensed Software contained no defect, the Licensee shall pay for any service provided by Logicasoft for the elimination of any reported incident and the location and resolution of an alleged defect at the normal applicable rates and in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of Logicasoft.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Licensee be provided with new releases of the software within the scope of the rectification, which, in comparison with the software originally acquired, have an extended scope of functionality and performance, the warranty rights of the Licensee shall not extend to the new, extended scope of functionality and performance. The warranty rights will never be prolonged by such provision (or by any other fact) either.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logicasoft assumes no liability for any suggestions or advice provided to the Licensee by employees of Logicasoft as a courtesy outside the contractual scope owed; this applies correspondingly for any assistance provided in this context.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Licensee acquired the Licensed Software from another party than Logicasoft (including from a Reseller), Licensee must address any claim to such third party or Reseller, which could process the claim according to its own procedures and, if applicable, according to its general terms and conditions of sale (which are only binding Licensee and the corresponding Reseller without having any effect as regards Logicasoft or the present EULA).</span>

Logicasoft &nbsp;is not responsible for loss of use of any website, internet access, hardware or software, loss of data, costs of re-creating lost data, the cost of any substitute performance, equipment, software or system, or claims by any party other than the Licensee.
